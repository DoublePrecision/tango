# CW2017

A Tango demonstration case for CW2017. This consists of three models at different resolutions passing 10 fields in a single direction. Atmosphere is approx 2 degrees, ice is 1/4 degree and ocean is 1/10 the degree. The atmosphere is written in Python, the others are in C++. 

The demo shows the simplicity of Tango configuration as well as start-up and runtime performance. A similar configuration has been developed using OASIS3-MCT for comparison purposes.
